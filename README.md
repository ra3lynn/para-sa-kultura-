# My Top 2 Favorite Filipino Foods ᕙ(`▿´)ᕗ
## Pork Sinigang
Sinigang has always been the only food I could eat days on days without getting tired of it. I love the sourness of the tamarind soup and all the vegetables that are included in the dish. The vegetables in the recipe are interchangeable. I mainly enjoy my sinigang with broccoli, okra, string beans, tomato, and onion. Most of these vegetables can be seen in the photo. You may also change out the type of meat in your sinigang. I've had it with fish before, but I also know that you can use beef.

## Pork Tocino
Tocino is my favorite Filipino breakfast food. Its flavor is the opposite of sinigang, which is sweet. Unlike sinigang I've never had it with any other meat besides pork. I love to eat it as shown in the picture, with rice and sometimes egg. The way it is cooked in the photo is how I like it. I enjoy it a little burnt. Something I do when I eat it is dip it in vinegar. It seems weird but I really like the sweetness of the tocino and sourness of the vinegar together.
